# 0.1.0 (January 30, 2019)

This release is considered a breaking change due to changes in the way the map
internal container sets it's size. Previously it was set to `100vh` so it would
allways take the full window height, now it is set to `100%` so it adapts to
the container size set by the user.

- [#1](https://github.com/ordazgustavo/here-maps-react/pull/1) Change vh to
  percent. ([@ordazsgustavo](https://github.com/ordazsgustavo))
- [#2](https://github.com/ordazgustavo/here-maps-react/pull/2) Remove Lodash
  dependency. ([@ordazsgustavo](https://github.com/ordazsgustavo))

# 0.0.1 (January 23, 2019)

Project release.
